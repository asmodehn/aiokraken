TODO
====

This is a short term todo list. issues can be thought of as less urgent.

- extract private stuff outside of market
- consolidate tradecost / tradevalue as part of market
- trade model in main package should probably go into model subpackage.
- regex matching as part of filter
- output file as result of analysis
- assets as currencies (decimal precision)
- currencies as units (pint)
- unify user interface around 2 or 3 concepts (mergeable selfupdating timeindexed dataframe, ... tbd ... )
- implement some kind of callback/"signal" when ohlc value fills some condition, as an example
