Test Structure does not have to reflect code structure.
But it should match code behavior (and available documentation from kraken)

Once we learn the behavior expected by kraken exchange, we should not hesitate to refactor this...
Especially we need to take into account the record tests versus the replay tests, and the public versus private tests, along with tests dependencies...
